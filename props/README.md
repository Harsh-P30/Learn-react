<h1>ðŸ’¥ What are props?</h1>
Props(short for properties) are inputs you pass from a parent component to a child component in React.
They let you send data,values or functions into components so they can behave dynamically.

<h5>why do we use props</h5>
<ul>
    <li>To customize a component's behavior.</li>
    <li>To reuse components with different data.</li>
    <li>To communicate between parent -> child components</li>
</ul>

<h5>Important Points</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Props are read-only inside the child.</li>
    <li>You can pass any type: sting, number, array, object, function.</li>
    <li>props allow component reuse with different content</li>
</ul>

âœ… If you initialize a variable without assigning a value, and your app or DOM still has old values from a previous render or cached build, the old values may continue showing in the UI until the new value is explicitly set or the app is fully rebuilt.

But important details:

    React does not automatically carry old values from the DOM into new variables.
    Instead:
    â†’ React re-renders based on state, props, and code.
    â†’ If you didnâ€™t clear or rebuild your code, old values might stay visible because the old JavaScript bundle is still running.

    The DOM itself doesnâ€™t keep variable values. It only reflects what React (or JavaScript) tells it to render.

    A cached bundler (like Parcel, Vite) or stale React state is usually the real reason why you see old values, not the DOM holding variables.
