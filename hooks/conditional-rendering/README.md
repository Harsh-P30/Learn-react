## Conditional rendering
In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, youâ€™ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:
```bash
let content;
if (isLoggedIn) {
  content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
  content = <LoginForm />;
}
return (
  <div>
    {content}
  </div>
);
```
