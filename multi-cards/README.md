<h1>Comonents</h1>
 Components in React are reusable building blocks that control what you see in the UI.A component is a JavaScript function (or class) that returns React elements (JSX) to show something on the screen. <br>
 <h3>🛠️ Types of components</h3>
<ul>

<li>Functional components → most common today (function MyComponent()) </li> 
<li>Class components → older style (class MyComponent extends React.Component)</li> 
</ul>

<h3>🔥 Why we use components: </h3> <br>
✅ Reuse UI <br>
✅ Keep code organized <br>
✅ Split big apps into small, testable parts <br>
✅ Pass data using props<br>
✅ Manage internal state (with hooks like useState) <br>
